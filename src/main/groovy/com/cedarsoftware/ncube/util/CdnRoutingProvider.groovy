/**
 * Implement this interface to set up the coordinate used to
 * access a CDN routing, templating, n-cube.  A CDN routing n-cube allows
 * n-cube to route logical CDN locations to physical locations.  The additional
 * information added to the n-cube input coordinate from the setupCoordinate()
 * API, allows additional scoping to be added which may change the location a
 * logical item on the CDN lives.  For example, businessUnit could be an axis,
 * and setting the businessUnit on the coordinate before the CDN routing n-cube
 * is accessed, allows the physical location on the CDN to be different per
 * business unit.  Similarly, other criteria could be taken into account in the
 * decision to map the logical CDN reference to a physical CDN reference.
